What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Hidden folder .git gets created, I need to use Git for my project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It contains all the files that are gonna be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I can add to the staging area only the files I want.
