How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It helped a lot cause otherwise shoulda checked manually!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Because I can check the progress that I made every time I edited a file. So I can change back to a prevoius working version in case something gets wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are to choose the proper time to commit (after a single logical change) and add a small description. The con is forgetting to commit or make too big or too small commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because Git is designed for code so many files could be related. Google Docs is a generic service.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log displays all the commits with id, description... Git diff compare 2 commits giving the ids to the command.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	Since I could completely go back to a previous commit of my repository.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to try using Git for all my future projects.
