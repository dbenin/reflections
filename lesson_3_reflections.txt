When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work with other people, work from different places, share my work with others or just having an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Maybe because I dont want to have a not working version online.
