When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work with other people, work from different places, share my work with others or just having an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Maybe because I dont want to have a not working version online.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Branches are inside the same repository and create a different path in the case I want to experiment with my code, clones clone an online repository to a local one (or local to local) and forks clone an online repository to another online repository.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It's helpful when merging the updated local version with the online version if changed.
